Project Name: Konnect Me

My team and I decided to build a website that increases accessibility when it comes to seniors connecting with other fellow seniors. 
Our goal is to offer elders opportunities to form meaningful connections and collaborate with their peers. Involvement and belonging to a community is crucial for happiness, especially at an old age.
Users can also enroll into and teach classes, which we believe would be a fun way for them to explore new topics and share knowledge.

Konnect Me fosters a sense of community and belonging, and promotes intergenerational understanding and respect.

We mainly focused on front-end development of the website, however we did attempt to integrate springboot (java) for user authentication, and created a new branch for it. The design for it is not yet complete, but we are planning to continue working on the project outside of the hackathon.
